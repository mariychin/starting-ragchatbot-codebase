# Frontend Changes - Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
Added essential code quality tools to the development workflow to ensure consistent, clean, and maintainable Python code across the RAG chatbot codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
Updated `pyproject.toml` with the following code quality tools:
- **black>=23.0.0** - Automatic code formatting
- **flake8>=6.0.0** - Code linting and style checking
- **isort>=5.12.0** - Import sorting and organization
- **mypy>=1.0.0** - Static type checking

### 2. Configuration Files Created

#### `.flake8`
- Configured maximum line length of 88 characters (matching Black)
- Ignored specific error codes (E203, W503) for Black compatibility
- Excluded common directories (.git, __pycache__, .venv, etc.)

#### `pyproject.toml` Tool Configuration
Added tool-specific configurations:
- **Black**: Line length 88, Python 3.13 target, exclude patterns
- **isort**: Black-compatible profile, consistent formatting
- **MyPy**: Strict type checking rules, Python 3.13 compatibility

### 3. Development Scripts

#### `format_code.py`
- Comprehensive Python script for running all formatting and quality checks
- Includes both check and fix modes
- Provides detailed feedback on each step
- Returns appropriate exit codes for CI/CD integration

#### `quality_check.sh`
- Bash script for running quality checks in Unix environments
- Sequential execution with early exit on failures
- Clear status reporting with emojis
- Non-blocking MyPy type checking

#### `run_quality_checks.py`
- Advanced quality checker with auto-fix capabilities
- Detailed reporting and summary statistics
- Command-line flag support (`--fix` for auto-fixing)
- Comprehensive error handling and tool detection

### 4. Quality Standards Implemented

#### Code Formatting
- Consistent 88-character line length
- Automatic import sorting and organization
- Black-style formatting throughout codebase
- Trailing comma enforcement for multi-line structures

#### Linting Rules
- PEP 8 compliance with Black-compatible exceptions
- Import organization and unused import detection
- Code complexity monitoring
- Docstring and comment standards

#### Type Checking
- Static type analysis for better code safety
- Function signature validation
- Return type verification
- Optional and union type handling

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Quality Check
```bash
python run_quality_checks.py
```

### Auto-fix Formatting Issues
```bash
python run_quality_checks.py --fix
```

### Individual Tool Usage
```bash
# Format code
python -m black .

# Sort imports
python -m isort .

# Check linting
python -m flake8 .

# Type checking
python -m mypy backend/
```

### Shell Script (Unix/Linux/macOS)
```bash
./quality_check.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Uniform code style across all Python files
2. **Maintainability**: Easier code reviews and collaboration
3. **Quality**: Early detection of potential issues and bugs
4. **Automation**: Integrated tools reduce manual formatting work
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Scripts provide proper exit codes for automated pipelines

## Next Steps

1. Install the new dependencies: Run `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run initial formatting: `python run_quality_checks.py --fix`
3. Integrate into development workflow
4. Consider adding pre-commit hooks for automatic checks
5. Add quality checks to CI/CD pipeline

## File Structure Added
```
├── .flake8                    # Flake8 configuration
├── format_code.py            # Basic formatting script
├── quality_check.sh          # Shell script for quality checks
├── run_quality_checks.py     # Advanced quality checker
└── pyproject.toml            # Updated with tool configurations
```

These changes establish a solid foundation for maintaining high code quality standards throughout the development process.
